She's back.
Love oo! Love oo! Love oo! No! Now, as this suggests, Mike is not what makes your heart skip.
I mean you love him but you're not in love with him.
That's why you can't say it.
I'm right, aren't I? Yes.
Oh, my Marple! Now, we need to work out how you'll end it.
Can't she just tell him? Just tell him? This guy! Miranda can't be direct.
It's a condition.
I call it Pushy Mother-itis and Acute Englishness-ness-ness.
She had to write a letter to switch gas suppliers.
Too scared to ring.
They make me feel guilty.
I end up signed to all protection plans and offering them a place to stay if they ever visit from Mumbai.
I mean to be fair, Raj and Miri were very nice.
Oh, they were lovely.
I'm gonna have to write Mike a letter, it's only way.
It's too mean! Come on.
Think and pace.
No, I really should THINK AND PACE! Well, we've run out of options.
Well, I've written him that letter.
You can't send that.
Why can't you be less mimsy? What's going on? She can't be direct because of a pushy mother.
She loves very much! That's my mother.
Oh, heavens above! We don't know.
I'm not pushy.
Miranda, you are to drop everything and order Mike to help me tonight.
I can't find Raymond but Mike could get us news coverage for the dinner.

Don't laugh.
I wouldn't laugh.
It's one of the reasons I love you.
What did you just say? I just said "I love you" but I mean, just flippantly.
How I say it to you.
Well, that's where you're mistaken, my massive friend.
We say it in a silly way.
Look, tell me you love me.
Love oo.
Please say you're finally getting this.
What truly makes your heart skip? Gary.
How do you see Mike? There we go.
How do you see Gary? Who do you love? Gary.

Something about having to end.
Having to end a contract with B and move to a new broadband package.

I'm having to act! Aah, Mike, she's told you.
About moving to a new broadband package, yes! Oh, yes, yes, tough times.
Mike's upset because his dog just died just now.
Oh, that is so annoying! Typical.
Isn't that annoying? Who's this? We don't know.
I was about to say it.
I'm ready to explode, like an emotional balloon.
Calm, you don't need to tell Gary now.
The only reason to panic was if Rose was getting her claws in.
She's been texting! He's not interested, so wait till Mike feels better! Who's Rose? Is everything all right? She's an emotional balloon because she's in love with Gary.

We've got nice breaks in Lanzarote for two.
Oh, it's for one.
For one? Er Ooh, Madeira.
No, two sharing.
Hefty single supplement.
Single supplement! Why? If anything, WE should be compensated for the amount of times we've had to send ourselves Valentines cards.
Not that I've done that.
I have done that.
And we use less linen, less shower gel and much more minibar.
Maybe if you used more shower gel, you'd be less single.
Just trying to storm out.
Sticky hinge there.
Who needs relationships when kittens, the culinary phrase, "Pierce film lid," and this bad boy are in the world? I give you the cushioned lap tray.

Why the zigzag when there's no-one here? Is this your bag, madam? Yes, is there a problem? It is now a suspicious package, madam.
Excuse me.
I do not have a suspicious package.
Well, it looks like a pretty suspicious package to us.
Well, if you don't pardon the euphemism, you're more likely to have a suspicious package.
Do you want to let the cat out of the bag? Open the case, please.
Ahh Someone needs to let the cat out of the bag I'll need to report this.
Well, she obviously just got in there when I was packing.
Can't you put her in a taxi to my home? Because I've got to get a flight.
I'd get in to trouble if I didn't let the cat out of the bag about letting the cat out of the bag.
You may not have noticed, but I didn't find the cat in the bag joke funny the first time.
Someone needs to let the cat out of the bag.
Terry, did you hear what I said? Because she's got a cat in her bag.
Oh, yeah, look.
Someone needs to let the cat out of the bag.
Someone needs to let the cat out of the bag.
If I hear cat in the bag one more time, I will blow.
I swear, I will blow! Ooh! Oh! Well, in some ways, this has ended how I'd like it.
Tena pads! Oh, there you are, darling.
You've just missed Pass the HRT Parcel.
Now it's time for Pin the Tail on Carol Vorderman's rear of the year.
Oh, big one! What are you doing? I'm on an emotional rollercoaster here.
Sheila was in my bag.
Don't laugh.
Oh, Stevie, I was so ready to go.
Grab the globe.
Wherever it lands, you go.
Right.
I bloody love Vorders! Ooh! Wick? Tippety top of Scotland.

This is it.
I'm sorry, but I'm leaving home and there was swelling music, so Tyrone! Look what this woman done! Wait! I'm on the wrong train.
I'm on the wrong bleeding train.

And I came straight away.
I've got something to say.
Oi! There she is.
Youths! Youths? Run! Oh, Miranda, what have you done now? Run! Wait for me! Come on! They won't be able to run for long.
Their trousers will trip them up.

So When Stevie told me that you were leaving, I knew what I had to do.
I had to let you go.
But There's a but.
Yeah, I'm manning up for my but.
Don't! But I realised I can't let you go.
Cos it's it's always been you.
Nice but.
Are you sure, Gary? Cos I sculpt fruit and call them names.
And when my breasts are bra-free, I can fit not just a pencil under them but both remote controls - it's where I keep them.
Wow! Was the remote control thing that sexy? No-one can match up to you.
I love you.
What are you doing? Bored of you already! What? I've got to go to the restaurant.

OK, I'm scared.
I think, can I meet your needs? Can I Yeah, you see, I know that you think that I'm needy but I'm not actually.
I am with you because you never affirm, Gary.
If a man says, "I love you," then that's all she needs.
I can't go for this if you're holding back.
Just be patient, please, for me? Ooh! You've had more farewells than Cher.
Are you staying? I don't know.

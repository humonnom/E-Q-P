Howard (arriving): Sorry I’m late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team’s design for the deep field space telescope that’s going on the International Space Station this spring.
(bigbang theory season5-5.txt, 170)
Howard: It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.

Penny: I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybody’s until Sheldon went on one of

Howard: Th-They did. But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station, so they’re putting me on an earlier launch.

Sheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it’s 8:13 and

Leonard: Like what? He’ll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter

Howard: Do I get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you

Howard: Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out
(bigbang theory season2 e1-8.txt, 2334)
Sheldon: Wash those bea… Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah, I’d better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?

Steph: Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff?
(bigbang theory season2 e9-16.txt, 435)
Sheldon: Penny, you face failure on a daily basis. How do you cope?
(bigbang theory season4.txt, 3840)
Sheldon: Are you sure you have enough comics? You’re going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, you’ve only selected seven hours of reading material. That’s even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt.

Bernadette: So where’s the telescope?
(bigbang theory season4.txt, 4621)
Raj: Hello, Hawaii. This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena. I’d like you to reposition the telescope, please. Scarlett Johansson’s house! I’m kidding, Hawaii. Mahalo. Whoo!
(bigbang theory season4.txt, 4797)
Raj: Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop.
(bigbang theory season4.txt, 4927)
Leonard: Really? You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?
(bigbang theory season4.txt, 4929)
Leonard: You get to play with Raj’s big telescope last night?
(bigbang theory season4.txt, 4949)
Raj: He never touched my telescope.

Amy: It’s too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, it’s fine.
(bigbang theory season4.txt, 5103)
Amy: Technically, Faisal is my fiance. But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter.

Howard: If that’s a working stethoscope, maybe you’d like to hear my heart skip a beat.
